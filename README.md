# Core

Core is a custom .NET Blazor WebAssembly template written in C# that provides a clean and simple website solution. With components for FontAwesome, all-in-one site title changes using SmartTitle, CSV and markdown parsing, Core offers a versatile toolkit for web development. 

## Features

- Integration with FontAwesome for rich and customizable icons.
- SmartTitle component for seamless site title management.
- CSV and markdown parsing for efficient data handling.
- Clean and simple website design with a top menu bar and footer, allowing ample space for content.

## Inspiration

Core draws inspiration from my earlier websites created in the 2010s. It incorporates the best practices and learnings from those projects to deliver an improved and refined web development experience.

### Compatibility

Although Core is based on my DOC website, it is important to note that the two APIs are incompatible. Core is designed as a separate and standalone project. However, you can leverage the knowledge and concepts gained from my previous work to enhance your development process.

## Usage

Core can be easily deployed using GitHub Pages. It features a ".nojekyll" file in the static file directory to ensure proper rendering and functionality.
